Bob got a task to invite <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> famous singers who would sing on the fest. He was too busy placing stages for their performances that he totally forgot to write the invitation e-mails on time, and unfortunately he only found <span class="tex-span"><i>K</i></span> available singers. Now there are more stages than singers, leaving some of the stages empty. Bob would not like if citizens of BubbleLand noticed empty stages and found out that he was irresponsible.</p><p>Because of that he decided to choose exactly <span class="tex-span"><i>K</i></span> stages that form a convex set, make large posters as edges of that convex set and hold festival inside. While those large posters will make it impossible for citizens to see empty stages outside Bob still needs to make sure they don't see any of the empty stages inside that area.</p><p>Since lots of people are coming, he would like that the festival area is as large as possible. Help him calculate the maximum area that he could obtain respecting the conditions. If there is no such area, the festival cannot be organized and the answer is 0.00.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i> (3 ≤ <i>N</i> ≤ 200)</span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>K</i> (3 ≤ <i>K</i> ≤ <i>min</i>(<i>N</i>, 50))</span>, separated with one empty space, representing number of stages and number of singers, respectively.</p><p>Each of the next <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> lines contains two integers <span class="tex-span"><i>X</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>Y</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> <span class="tex-span">(0 ≤ <i>X</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub>, <i>Y</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">6</sup>)</span> representing the coordinates of the stages.
