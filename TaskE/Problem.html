You can perform the following operation any number of times: select several distinct indices $$$i_1, i_2, \dots, i_k$$$ ($$$1 \le i_j \le n$$$) and move the number standing at the position $$$i_1$$$ to the position $$$i_2$$$, the number at the position $$$i_2$$$ to the position $$$i_3$$$, ..., the number at the position $$$i_k$$$ to the position $$$i_1$$$. In other words, the operation cyclically shifts elements: $$$i_1 \to i_2 \to \ldots i_k \to i_1$$$.</p><p>For example, if you have $$$n=4$$$, an array $$$a_1=10, a_2=20, a_3=30, a_4=40$$$, and you choose three indices $$$i_1=2$$$, $$$i_2=1$$$, $$$i_3=4$$$, then the resulting array would become $$$a_1=20, a_2=40, a_3=30, a_4=10$$$.</p><p>Your goal is to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order with the minimum number of operations. The additional constraint is that the sum of cycle lengths over all operations should be less than or equal to a number $$$s$$$. If it's impossible to sort the array while satisfying that constraint, your solution should report that as well.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 200\,000$$$, $$$0 \leq s \leq 200\,000$$$)—the number of elements in the array and the upper bound on the sum of cycle lengths.</p><p>The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$—elements of the array ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>If it's impossible to sort the array using cycles of total length not exceeding $$$s$$$, print a single number &quot;<span class="tex-font-style-tt">-1</span>&quot; (quotes for clarity).</p><p>Otherwise, print a single number $$$q$$$— the minimum number of operations required to sort the array.</p><p>On the next $$$2 \cdot q$$$ lines print descriptions of operations in the order they are applied to the array. The description of $$$i$$$-th operation begins with a single line containing one integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le n$$$)—the length of the cycle (that is, the number of selected indices). The next line should contain $$$k$$$ distinct integers $$$i_1, i_2, \dots, i_k$$$ ($$$1 \le i_j \le n$$$)—the indices of the cycle.</p><p>The sum of lengths of these cycles should be less than or equal to $$$s$$$, and the array should be sorted after applying these $$$q$$$ operations.</p><p>If there are several possible answers with the optimal $$$q$$$, print any of them.</p></div><div class="sample-tests"><div class="section-title">Examples</div><div class="sample-test"><div class="input"><div class="title">Input</div><pre>5 5<br />3 2 3 1 1<br /></pre></div><div class="output"><div class="title">Output</div><pre>1<br />5<br />1 4 2 3 5 <br /></pre></div><div class="input"><div class="title">Input</div><pre>4 3<br />2 1 4 3<br /></pre></div><div class="output"><div class="title">Output</div><pre>-1</pre></div><div class="input"><div class="title">Input</div><pre>2 0<br />2 2<br /></pre></div><div class="output"><div class="title">Output</div><pre>0<br /></pre></div></div></div><div class="note"><div class="section-title">Note</div><p>In the first example, it's also possible to sort the array with two operations of total length 5: first apply the cycle $$$1 \to 4 \to 1$$$ (of length 2), then apply the cycle $$$2 \to 3 \to 5 \to 2$$$ (of length 3). However, it would be wrong answer as you're asked to use the minimal possible number of operations, which is 1 in that case.</p><p>In the second example, it's possible to the sort the array with two cycles of total length 4 ($$$1 \to 2 \to 1$$$ and $$$3 \to 4 \to 3$$$). However, it's impossible to achieve the same using shorter cycles, which is required by $$$s=3$$$.</p><p>In the third example, the array is already sorted, so no operations are needed. Total length of empty set of cycles is considered to be zero.</p></div></div><p>  </p></div>
