And it's not just some ordinary exam, it's on mathematical analysis. Of course, right now Vasya can only think of one thing: what the result of his talk with the examiner will be...</p><p>To prepare for the exam, one has to study proofs of <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> theorems. It is known that there will be <span class="tex-span"><i>k</i></span> examination cards on the exam and each card contains <img align="middle" class="tex-formula" src="/predownloaded/22/c3/22c3a46b1bf8218a135a7cdc3e2867f958f1f3a5.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" /> distinct theorems. Besides, no theorem is mentioned in more than one card (that is, <img align="middle" class="tex-formula" src="/predownloaded/15/b7/15b7d70fa74bc1f5aff2769b30e013a28daebc5c.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" /> theorems won't be mentioned in any card). During the exam several students may get the same card.</p><p>We do not know the exact way theorems are distributed by cards, however the students that took the exam before Vasya told him what theorems their cards contained. Vasya evaluates his <span class="tex-font-style-underline">level of proficiency in the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th theorem</span> by some number <span class="tex-span"><i>a</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span>. <span class="tex-font-style-underline">The level of proficiency in some card</span> is the average of the levels of proficiency in the theorems that are included in the card. Now Vasya wants to know the minimally and maximally possible levels of his proficiency in the card he gets on the exam. Vasya wants to determine it by the data he has collected from other students. Unfortunately, Vasya has no time left to do the math and he asked you to help him.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>k</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>k</i> ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 100</span>) — the number of theorems and the number of cards correspondingly.

They are the numbers of theorems included in the card in the order in which they are enumerated in the input data. The numbers are given in an arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that the given cards are valid (that is, that all theorems in one card are different and that different people get cards that either don't contain the same theorems or coincide up to the theorems' permutation).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>Print two real numbers, representing Vasya's minimum and maximum proficiency in the card he will get on the exam.
